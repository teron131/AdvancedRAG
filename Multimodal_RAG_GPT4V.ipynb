      "###ANSWER###\n",
      "Based on the extracted content, there are several methods mentioned for improving WiFi latency, particularly in the context of gaming and enterprise conferencing, which can be generalized to other applications as well. These methods include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Video Game Traffic Prioritization**: Over the Wi-Fi link between the end user and the Wi-Fi router, prioritizing video game traffic can help reduce latency. This involves maintaining and honoring Quality of Service (QoS) tags in ISPs' core networks.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Wireless Channel Selection**: Choosing the optimal wireless channel can help in reducing interference and, consequently, improving latency.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Deployment of AQM or Priority Queuing Mechanisms**: To combat Bufferbloat in the downstream WAN queue, deploying Active Queue Management (AQM) or priority queuing mechanisms can be effective. Bufferbloat is a significant cause of high latency, and managing it can substantially improve performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Deep Packet Inspection (DPI)**: In enterprise scenarios, DPI can be used to classify packets as pertinent to a specific application (e.g., conferencing tools) and prioritize them over others within the network. This can ensure that critical applications receive the bandwidth and low latency they require.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Application-Specific Configuration**: For enterprise conferencing, configuring specific applications to assign appropriate priority to their traffic can maintain required latency bounds and minimize packet loss.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Time-of-Day Prioritization**: Prioritizing certain applications over others based on the time of day can also be an effective strategy. For example, business-critical applications can be given priority during business hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "These strategies are aimed at optimizing the Quality of Service (QoS) over Wi-Fi links, ensuring that latency-sensitive applications like gaming and video conferencing can operate smoothly without perceptible delays or video artifacts. Implementing these strategies requires a combination of network management, application-specific configurations, and possibly hardware adjustments to ensure that traffic is prioritized effectively and that the network is configured to minimize latency.\n",

      "\n",
      "Conference calls within the Enterprise enable collaboration without complicating the participants’ schedules too much (eliminates time for the participants to travel to the meeting location, allows for participants to multi-task, etc.). However, for the conference call to be productive, the quality of voice, data and video should be perfect, so that the discussions, debates, and outcomes are equivalent to what it would have been if the participants met face-to-face.\n",

      "Mandating a specific conferencing application configured specifically for the Enterprise enables assignment of appropriate priority to the payload corresponding to the application, to maintain required latency bounds, eliminate or minimize packet loss and avoid congestion due to other activities in the Enterprise network.\n",
      "\n",
      "In some scenarios, the Enterprise conferencing may include participants from organizations outside the Enterprise resulting in not being able to use the Enterprise Conferencing application (e.g., Standards meeting involving members from various companies using an application mandated by the Standards Organization, conferencing between two or more collaborating parties that use different conferencing tools, etc.). In these cases, within the Enterprise (that participates in the inter-party conference using a conferencing tool that is not the preferred tool within the Enterprise) can improve QoS for the conference by performing deep packet inspection (DPI) to classify the packets as pertinent to the conference and prioritize them over others within the Enterprise network.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the Enterprise, there is also a need for prioritizing certain applications over others based on the time of day. For instance, business-critical conferences are a priority during business hours but personal conferences by employees after business hours should be prioritized (as a reward for employees choosing to stay after hours and work).\n",

      "2.3.1 Networked Full-Featured Gaming Consoles\n",
      "\n",
      "Many gamers have a gaming console which is fully featured in terms of computing, memory, and display resources. The network only provides a means for keeping the game coordinated in terms of individual player action(s) and the combined outcome of the action(s) by all the players – the combined outcome being a synchronized audio-visual output resulting from the players’ action(s).\n",
      "\n",
      "From a QoS perspective the network in this case needs to provide appropriate prioritization for the payloads carrying individual player action(s) and the corresponding change to the game in order to keep the combined outcome synchronized across all the networked gaming consoles. The typical gaming payload in the case is small but requires no loss or ultra-low latency to maintain the gaming experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "QoE: The audio-visual output of all the networked gaming consoles remains the same (perfectly synchronized) and the response to an individual player’s action is reflected seamlessly across all the gaming consoles.\n",
      "\n",
      "KPI: Packet loss, response time to an individual player’s action, lag in the synchronization of the audio- visual output across the networked gaming consoles, worst-case and average end-to-end latency for individual player’s action payload (and what part of it is contributed by the network).\n",
      "\n",
      "2.3.2 Minimally Resourced Gaming Consoles Networked To a Fully Resourced Gaming Server At The Venue\n",
      "\n",
      "The main difference in this case is that the individual gaming consoles are minimally resourced – i.e., high-end audio / video codecs with enough compute / memory resources to provide the best audio- visual display of the game to each individual user and the corresponding controller to capture the individual user action(s). The uplink network requirements are the same as that of the Networked full- featured gaming consoles case while the downlink is compressed content representing the combined outcome of all action(s) by all the players.\n",
      "\n",
      "Note that the downlink stream can be multicast since the combined outcome is the same and by doing that some of the synchronization issues in the previous use case may be mitigated.\n",

      "\n",
      "In some scenarios, the Enterprise conferencing may include participants from organizations outside the Enterprise resulting in not being able to use the Enterprise Conferencing application (e.g., Standards meeting involving members from various companies using an application mandated by the Standards Organization, conferencing between two or more collaborating parties that use different conferencing tools, etc.). In these cases, within the Enterprise (that participates in the inter-party conference using a conferencing tool that is not the preferred tool within the Enterprise) can improve QoS for the conference by performing deep packet inspection (DPI) to classify the packets as pertinent to the conference and prioritize them over others within the Enterprise network.\n",

      "In the Enterprise, there is also a need for prioritizing certain applications over others based on the time of day. For instance, business-critical conferences are a priority during business hours but personal conferences by employees after business hours should be prioritized (as a reward for employees choosing to stay after hours and work).\n",

      "The most well-known mechanism to mitigate performance losses in real-time applications is the Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA); standardized in IEEE 802.11e and specified under WI-FI Alliance’s Wi-Fi Multimedia (WMM). In EDCA, a traffic is given an access category (AC) defining its channel access parameters. These AC specific channel access parameters give priority to traffics with higher priority over traffics with lower priority; both between different competing Wi-Fi devices and within the same Wi-Fi device. WMM defines four ACs in descending priority: AC_VO (Voice), AC_VI (Video), AC_BE (Best Effort), and AC_BK (Background). WMM also defines how the 802.1Q user priorities (UPs) are mapped into the ACs (Table 1). However, it does not specify how higher-level packet tags (i.e., Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) tags) shall be mapped into the UPs.\n",
