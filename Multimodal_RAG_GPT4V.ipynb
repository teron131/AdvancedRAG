      "The most well-known mechanism to mitigate performance losses in real-time applications is the Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA); standardized in IEEE 802.11e and specified under WI-FI Alliance’s Wi-Fi Multimedia (WMM). In EDCA, a traffic is given an access category (AC) defining its channel access parameters. These AC specific channel access parameters give priority to traffics with higher priority over traffics with lower priority; both between different competing Wi-Fi devices and within the same Wi-Fi device. WMM defines four ACs in descending priority: AC_VO (Voice), AC_VI (Video), AC_BE (Best Effort), and AC_BK (Background). WMM also defines how the 802.1Q user priorities (UPs) are mapped into the ACs (Table 1). However, it does not specify how higher-level packet tags (i.e., Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) tags) shall be mapped into the UPs.\n",
